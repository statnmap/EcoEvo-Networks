# EcoEvo-Networks
My long term attempt to show how dispersal network structure alters eco-evolutionary dynamics in a predator-prey system. 
This project started in christimas period 2019 and its exclusively my christmas fun, meaning I am working on it only during christmas period 
and not working hours.
